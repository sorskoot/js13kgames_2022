TODO

Big decisions to take:
    - Use the audio design of the contest or add real background audio? or both? 

Backlog:
    Clean up code and get back to WebPack build pipeline:
        ✔ Webpack @done(22-10-14 20:53)
        ☐ rename the crappy names back to normal
        ☐ import/export
        ☐ images removed from base64        

    ☐ improve ECS, maybe replace with real framework (ECSY? (https://blog.mozvr.com/introducing-ecsy/))
    ☐ Add back in the removed background audio.    
    ☐ Improve title screen and gameover screen.
    ☐ improve hitbox of the player
    ☐ improve hitbox of the skeletons    
    ☐ improve levels with more obstacles
    ☐ add more levels
    ☐ better handle non vr devices        
    ☐ Indicate being hit with postprocessing effect turning screen red for a flash
    ☐ Die after a couple of hits
    ☐ More different skeletons    
    ☐ Better animations
    ☐ Better sounds
    ☐ spatial audio
    ☐ A shovel instead of a bat to better sell the story of you working at the graveyard.
    ☐ Add Webmonetization link
    ☐ Better model of flashlight
    ☐ A nightsky texture, with a big moon
    ☐ Instructions (Spoken?)
    ☐ Thick fog on the ground.
    ☐ Zesty ads
    ☐ PWA for itch.io and Side Quest.

Preparation:
    ✔ Build pipeline
    ✔ SFX @done(22-08-13 18:47)   
        ✔ Audio lib is too old, it needs to be replaced. It might be worth testing if just a base64 encode .wav isn't as good since that what is generated anyway, but we might be able to skip the entire library because audio is in Babylon. @done(22-09-03 00:56)
    ✘ Pixel Shader @cancelled(22-08-19 17:31) Not needed (probably)    
        
Game idea:
    # Skeletons rise from their graves, you have to hit/shoot them back

Bugs:
    ☐ @high When exiting VR after game over all title are shown at the same time
    ☐ @critical Collider when getting hit by skeleton seems off. Sometime you get hit by the skeleton when the skeleton is far away.
    ✔ Walls are gone @done(22-09-07 22:29)
    ✔ When exiting VR the skeletons are still shown @done(22-09-07 21:35)
    ✔ Graves should face the player @done(22-09-06 22:42)

Must have:
    GameStates:
        ✔ A Title @done(22-08-24 23:02)
        ✔ A Gameover screen @done(22-08-26 12:08)
        ✔ Playing @done(22-08-24 23:02)
        ✔ Switching states @done(22-08-26 12:08)
    ✔ Skelton Spawning @done(22-08-23 23:55)
        # how to make it clear where they are spawning? 
    ✔ Move skeletons towards player @done(22-08-23 23:55)
    ✔ Hitting Skeletons @done(22-08-23 23:55)
    ✔ Die if hit by skelly @done(22-08-26 12:08)
    ✔ Keep count of how many are killed @done(22-08-30 22:42)
    ✔ Go to next level after all skeletons are killed @done(22-09-07 22:37)
    Level Control:
        ✔ Spawn in different ways (multple at the same time, faster over time) @done(22-09-06 21:52)
        ✔ When hit, remove all skeletons. @done(22-09-06 21:52)
        ✔ When starting, start with a clean map 1 @done(22-09-06 21:52)

Should have:
    ✔ Clear Entities when no longer used. @done(22-08-26 13:44)
    ☐ Indicate being hit with postprocessing effect turning screen red for a flash
        https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/postProcesses/usePostProcesses#custom-postprocesses
    ✔ Increasing difficulty in waves of skeletons. @done(22-09-07 21:56)
        Maybe different places in the graveyard. It would be really nice to have some
        way of focussing the attention of the player in a direction. Maybe by drawing a 
        wall or foliage or something.
        Level 1, only skeletons from the front
        Level 2, from the front and the back
        Level x, all directions
    ✔ Sound effects @done(22-09-03 00:46)
    ✔ Particle effects when hitting the skeleton @done(22-08-24 21:28)
    ☐ Die after a couple of hits
    ✔ Particles flow in direction of hit @done(22-09-03 00:47)
    ✔ UI showing how many skeletons killed @done(22-09-03 00:47)
        material.forceDepthWrite   
        material.needDepthPrePass         
    ☐ A shovel instead of a bat to better sell the story of you working at the graveyard.
    ☐ Add Webmonetization link
    ✔ Show a message when changing levels describing what to do. @done(22-09-07 23:36)
    ✔ Animate the rising from the ground of the skeletons @done(22-08-31 22:45)

Could have:
    Paricles should have a better color in the darkness. not glowing by itself.
    ☐ Nice sound effects
    ✔ Controller rumble on hit @done(22-09-06 21:52)
    ☐ A nightsky texture, with a big moon
    ✔ Paths between the graves @done(22-09-06 21:52)
    ✔ Dark trees in the background @done(22-09-06 00:40)

Would like:
    ☐ Bigger graves and tombs
    ☐ Make battery of flashlight slowly drain
    ☐ Thick fog on the ground.

Random ideas:
    items: 
        - Shovel
        - Flashlight
        - Bat        
        - Gun
        - Grenade        

    Title ideas:
        # - SVG Might be a nice way to go with text and effects
        # - Might need to draw SVG to canvas http://jsfiddle.net/Na6X5/
        - https://codepen.io/gabecrockett/pen/QWWzRvm
        - https://codepen.io/lbebber/pen/KwGEQv        
        Transparent text in a texture => https://playground.babylonjs.com/#5ZCGRM#2847

        To get the screen to turn red, maybe a very dense red fog might give the
        effect instead of a post filter.

    # Level Ideas
    Level 1 - At the gate of the graveyard
        Skeletons only spawn in front of you and there are not many
        There's a wall left and right of you and a gate behind you

    Level 2 - You are a bit furter into the graveyard
        Skeletons spawn in front and left of you
        You stand in the corner between two walls
    Level 3 - You are in the middle of the graveyard
        Skeletons come from 3 directions, front left and right  
        There's a wall behind you
    Level 4 - You are in the middle of the graveyard
        Skeletons come from 3 directions, front left and right  
        No wall, but graves are grouped in for mayor directions
    Level 5 - You're on your own now
        No wall, graves everywhere.
