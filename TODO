Preparation:
    ✔ Build pipeline
    ✔ SFX @done(22-08-13 18:47)   
        - Audio lib is too old, it needs to be replaced. It might be worth testing if just a base64 encode .wav isn't as good since that what is generated anyway, but we might be able to skip the entire library because audio is in Babylon.
    ✘ Pixel Shader @cancelled(22-08-19 17:31) Not needed (probably)    
        

Game idea:
    # Skeletons rise from their graves, you have to hit/shoot them back


Must have:
    ☐ A Title 
    ☐ A Gameover screen
    ☐ Skelton Spawning
        # how to make it clear where they are spawning? 
    ☐ Move skeletons towards player
    ☐ Hitting Skeletons
    ☐ Die if hit by skelly
    ☐ Keep count of how many re-killed

Should have:
    ☐ Indicate being hit with postprocessing effect turning screen red for a flash
        https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/postProcesses/usePostProcesses#custom-postprocesses
    ☐ Increasing difficulty in waves of skeletons. 
        Maybe different places in the graveyard. It would be really nice to have some
        way of focussing the attention of the player in a direction. Maybe by drawing a 
        wall or foliage or something.
        Level 1, only skeletons from the front
        Level 2, from the front and the back
        Level x, all directions
    ☐ Nice sound effects
    ☐ Particle effects when hitting the skeleton

Could have:
    ☐ A nightsky texture, with a big moon
    ☐ Paths between the graves    
    ☐ Music

Would like:
    ☐ Bigger graves and tombs

Random ideas:
    items: 
        - Shovel
        - Flashlight
        - Bat        
        - Gun
        - Grenade        



    Title ideas:
        # - SVG Might be a nice way to go with text and effects
        # - Might need to draw SVG to canvas http://jsfiddle.net/Na6X5/
