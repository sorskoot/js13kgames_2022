Preparation:
    ✔ Build pipeline
    ✔ SFX @done(22-08-13 18:47)   
        - Audio lib is too old, it needs to be replaced. It might be worth testing if just a base64 encode .wav isn't as good since that what is generated anyway, but we might be able to skip the entire library because audio is in Babylon.
    ✘ Pixel Shader @cancelled(22-08-19 17:31) Not needed (probably)
    Place holders:
        ☐ Title screen
        ☐ Game over screen
    Code:
        ☐ Game states
        

Game idea:
    # Skeletons rise from their graves, you have to hit/shoot them back


Must have:
    - A Title 
    - Skelton Spawning
        # how to make it clear where they are spawning? 
    - Hitting Skeletons

Should have:
    - Increasing difficulty in waves of skeletons. 
        Maybe different places in the graveyard. It would be really nice to have some
        way of focussing the attention of the player in a direction. Maybe by drawing a 
        wall or foliage or something.
        Level 1, only skeletons from the front
        Level 2, from the front and the back
        Level x, all directions

Could have:


Would like:

    Title ideas:
        # - SVG Might be a nice way to go with text and effects
        # - Might need to draw SVG to canvas http://jsfiddle.net/Na6X5/
